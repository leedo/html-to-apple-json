<p>In a little-noticed change to the company’s <a href="http://sy.com/legal/terms-of-use/">Terms of Use</a> that took effect last month, the online craft retailer has now restructured itself such that it now has an Irish subsidiary, Etsy Ireland, an unlimited liability corporation. The move allows Etsy to now take advantage of a tool that has become all-too-common among major tech companies, including Apple, Google, IBM, and others, as a way to both conceal financial disclosures and drastically reduce global tax obligations. (<a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-08-14/etsy-taps-secret-irish-tax-haven-and-touts-transparency-at-home">Bloomberg</a> was the first to report on this change.)</p>
<p>Etsy’s move is particularly eyebrow-raising given that it has a "<a href="http://www.bcorporation.net/what-are-b-corps/the-non-profit-behind-b-corps">B Lab certification</a>," under which it agrees to use business "as a force for good," and "be the change we seek in the world." That designation means while Etsy remains a for-profit company as organized under Delaware state law, it is supposed to adhere to certain self-imposed ethical principles.</p>
<p>The Brooklyn-based company declared that it is a "mindful, transparent, and humane business" in its <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1370637/000119312515077045/d806992ds1.htm">investor prospectus</a> (S-1) filing with the Securities and Exchange Corporation prior to going public earlier this year.</p>
<p>"Many people will tell you that Google shouldn't do it," Omri Marian, a tax law professor at the University of California, Irvine, told Ars by e-mail. "So if Google shouldn't do it, a corporation that presents itself as supporting social sustainability definitely shouldn’t."</p>
<h2>Totally legal</h2>
<p>So how financially advantageous are these corporate moves? Put it this way: Google’s overseas <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-10-21/google-2-4-rate-shows-how-60-billion-u-s-revenue-lost-to-tax-loopholes.html">tax rate was 2.4 percent</a> in 2009, the lowest of all American tech companies when measured by market capitalization. As Ars <a href="http://arstechnica.com/business/2013/10/to-reduce-its-tax-burden-google-expands-use-of-the-double-irish/">reported</a> in October 2013, Google is now moving even more money through a shell corporation in Bermuda—reaching a total of €8.8 billion ($11.91 billion) in 2012, 25 percent more than it did in 2011. Still, Etsy is unlikely to save anywhere close to this scale: the company lost $42.9 million in the first half of 2015.</p>
<p>Pearse Trust, an Ireland-based corporate consultancy firm, even <a href="http://www.pearse-trust.ie/blog/bid/97346/Unlimited-Companies-In-Ireland-An-Overview-In-2-Minutes">summarized</a> the secrecy reasons this way:</p>
<blockquote><p>Many may be motivated to incorporate or convert to an unlimited company for confidentiality reasons. Although an unlimited company is obliged to file an annual return, it is, in certain circumstances, relieved of the obligation to file accompanying accounts. The state of the company’s financial affairs does not, therefore, become a matter of public record.<i> </i></p></blockquote>

The Netherlands reviews its role in tax avoidance</a></h2><p>For example, Dell's Dutch subsidiary only paid 0.10 percent tax on $2B profits.</p></div></aside>Bloomberg <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-10-21/google-2-4-rate-shows-how-60-billion-u-s-revenue-lost-to-tax-loopholes.html">first described</a> the process of its money movements (known as the "Double Irish") in 2010. As <a href="http://arstechnica.com/business/2012/11/dutch-sandwich-with-a-side-of-tax-relief-may-soon-be-off-googles-menu/">we have also reported</a>, here’s how the Double Irish works: a company sells or licenses its foreign rights to intellectual property developed in the United States to a subsidiary in a country with lower tax rates. The result? Foreign profits that come from that tech are now attributed to that offshore subsidiary rather than the American headquarters. The subsidiaries have to pay "arm’s length" prices for those rights, just like an outside company would, but in reality they often don’t.</p>
<p>In the future, Etsy could take advantage of a similar system, but does not at present. While Etsy has existed as a corporation since 2006, it wasn’t until this year that the company re-organized its global corporate structure to include Etsy Ireland. [<strong>UPDATE</strong>: Taylor Watson, an Etsy spokeswoman, e-mailed Ars to clarify: "We do not employ a Double Irish structure."]</p>
<p>In its <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1370637/000162828015004429/etsy331201510q.htm">first quarterly earnings report</a> since going public in April 2015, Etsy wrote in May:</p>
<blockquote><p>In January 2015, the Company implemented an updated global corporate structure to more closely align with its global operations and future expansion plans outside of the United States. The new structure changes how the Company uses its intellectual property and implements certain intercompany arrangements, which the Company believes may result in a reduction in its overall effective tax rate and other operational efficiencies. The revised structure resulted in the setup of a deferred tax liability in the amount of $67.8 million on the taxable gain created in the transaction. A deferred charge was recorded for the same amount representing the future income tax which will be amortized into income tax expense over five years. During the three months ended March 31, 2015, $6.1 million was recorded to income tax expense.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.law.gwu.edu/Faculty/profile.aspx?id=11219">Neil Buchanan</a>, a tax law professor at George Washington University, gave Ars his assessment of the corporate-speak.</p>
<p>"Translation: We figured out a technically legal way to cut our tax bill, and it doesn't bother us that doing so reduces the ability of our government to fund programs that we otherwise claim to support," he wrote. "We'll get back to you when we've figured out any other 'operational efficiencies' that we might exploit."</p>

Under that agreement, the company must recertify away from its existing corporate structure after going public.</p>
<p>"The re-certification process requires the completion of a new B Impact Assessment which includes a Disclosure Questionnaire (B Lab also conducts a simultaneous background check)," Katie Holcomb, a B Lab spokeswoman, told Ars. "This Disclosure Questionnaire has a question about the use of corporate structures to avoid taxes. The question is: ‘Has the Company reduced or minimized taxes through the use of corporate shells or structural means?’"</p>
<p>She was unable to answer whether such a corporate shuffle would impact Etsy’s B Lab certification but said that the company has "been cooperative throughout" and that the process would take another "month or two."</p>
<p>It's apparently quite rare for any of existing B Lab certified companies to use corporate structures to minimize taxes in this way; Etsy is probably the first to use this creative Irish structure.</p>
<p>"Only seven companies out of around 1,350 have effectively answered 'yes' to this disclosure question," Holcomb added. "In each of these cases, B Lab deemed this issue immaterial requiring no further disclosure. For context, each of the US companies were quite small, with revenues under $2 million. Given their size, we think it unlikely that any of these seven companies were using the Irish unlimited liability company structure you mentioned."</p>
<p>All B Lab certified companies must transition away from their for-profit C-corporation status to a legally recognized public benefit B-corporation within a few years. In Etsy’s case, it would be required to do so by July 2017.</p>

<p>"As we continue to grow and expand our international business, we are generating an increasing amount of revenue and intellectual property outside of the US," she wrote. "As a result, after careful consideration and consultation, we evolved our tax structure to accurately account for the value of that property. We pay taxes at the local rate and make all required filings in the jurisdictions in which we operate."</p>
<p>That type of legal skirting isn’t good enough for tax law experts.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.luc.edu/media/lucedu/law/faculty/images/brunson.jpg">Samuel Brunson</a>, a tax law professor at Loyola University Chicago, told Ars that such a move suggests that the scheme "must offer pretty substantial tax savings."</p>
<p>"There is clearly substantial pressure from investors to make sufficient profit, even when investors know in advance that the company intends to be socially responsible," he said. "The Certified B is supposed to send a signal to investors, but they didn't catch (or ignored) the signal, and it looks like it hasn't given Etsy's managers cover (or permission) to focus on the other constituencies."</p>
<p>Neil Buchanan, the George Washington University law professor, said that such a move was "absolutely inappropriate."</p>
<p>"If it were up to me, it would be illegal and not just unethical, but even though it's currently legal, a company that holds itself out as being socially responsible should be called out on this stuff," he said. "It's like <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/chatterbox/2006/10/bono_tax_avoider.html">U2's sketchy tax moves</a>. They're not in a position to invoke Mitt Romney's ‘I paid every penny of tax due under the law, but nothing more.’ Neither is Etsy."</p>
