      "text" : "Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain arrives under so much hype, expectation, and otaku-fever that it’s almost destined to fail. In true Kojima fashion, this is a polarising game, one where the highest of highs is offset with lowest of lows. It distorts much of what has made the third-person stealth action series so revered, replacing the heavily structured levels of old with an open-world setting that allows for a more flexible approach. The series' latest iteration presents greater opportunities to succeed spectacularly and fail wretchedly. An RPG-like system of unlocking and upgrading weapons requires you think four or five moves ahead, while an AI-controlled \"buddy\" option provides the kind of obliging assistance that many would consider sacrilege in a game of this type.\n\nDespite the distortion, however, MGS V never feels like anything less than Metal Gear Solid. It's this—the way the game drastically alters series tropes while simultaneously staying true to the essence of a Big Boss adventure—that singles out Kojima as a master designer. Partly, it's thanks to the core mechanics remaining largely the same. Playing as the special operations soldier Punished \"Venom\" Snake (aka Big Boss), you creep around hallways, bushes, crates, or whatever other conveniently placed bits of cover are lying around, quietly taking out soldiers with a choke, slam, or a smooth disarm. There are a few minor differences—a day and night cycle introduces different patrols, while interrogations look a little different—but this is very much a Metal Gear Solid game at heart.\n\nWhere Kojima's design chops come into play are in the differences. The open-world descriptor, for instance, hints at a Grand Theft Auto or Skyrim-like expanse to explore. But while you can travel through the opening Afghanistan region to your heart's content—coming across enemy outposts and bases, hunting the fauna, gathering the flora, and enjoying the way the light dramatically alters the desert horizon as day turns to night—the majority of important locations can only be found by following a set path through a closed canyon or along a narrow ridge.\n\nWhile it is possible to gallop on horseback across open plains between certain inhabited areas, much of your time is spent trying to work out which route the game wants you to take to take in order to reach a specific mission. It’s fashionable these days to crush anything that has the audacity to try and take freedom away from the player, but MGS V's vision of a guided open world works brilliantly within the wider framework of this series. By isolating different enemy positions from each other, the world map ends up being fragmented into many levels—of differing size, complexity, and difficulty—with open space filling the gaps. Throughout the open space it's incredibly rare to run into enemies, and when you do they're usually driving a vehicle of some sort so that it’s easy to hear them coming and duck out of sight.\n\nThis allows you to get stuck into missions and combat, but it also offers you an escape back into relative calm should you get in over your head. Foes will rarely pursue you far from the location they're stationed at, but it is worth keeping in mind that guards will still be on high alert (and may have called in reinforcements) should you decide to revisit an area you've just narrowly escaped from. It’s akin to that of retrying a level that you've failed over and over again, providing that distinct tunnel vision of hitting your goal that previous Metal Gear Solid titles have always done so well.\n\nUltimately, if you were worried that the move to an open world would equate to a loss of those more intimate moments in which timing your move from one set of crates to another is of supreme importance, you can put those fears to bed.",

      "text" : "A more open environment does force you to add new sets of skills to your arsenal, though. If you're the type that prefers to stay invisible at all times and not have to ever use a weapon, you need to quickly learn new techniques and have the patience required to properly scout an area before entering it. The environment helps things along with plenty of peaks and outcrops from which to scan a location with your binoculars, tag enemies to more easily track them, and memorise the best means in and out of a hostile zone.\n\nLater in the game this process becomes decidedly easier as you unlock those aforementioned \"buddies\" to assist you. A certain buddy might help you with identifying the position of guards, while another might be able to dispatch of them silently. Cleverly, the difficulty ratchets up to match any such abilities you acquire, so it’s wise to develop your scouting in anticipation for tougher challenges ahead. Most of those arrive during the final third of the game, but the narrative only makes up only a small portion of the total number of missions. Where MGS V takes a more traditional approach to an open world is by packing the game out with side missions. Some of these are entirely optional, the reward coming in the form of resources and/or new recruits to enhance Mother Base. Others—without giving away any of the story—we'd suggest you consider tackling a little earlier on.\n\nIn a neat twist, Snake doesn't speak the languages native to the regions he visits, meaning you need an interpreter to decipher the local dialects. With an interpreter on board you can then interrogate guards for more info, learning everything from where their comrades are positioned to which buildings hold rare resources. Recruiting an interpreter means venturing out into the wilderness to find one, so you need to keep track of the available side missions and embark on any relevant ones when they become available. While that’s something of a chore, the missions themselves are at least entertaining, with some involving kidnapping a bilingual enemy or rescuing a similarly skilled prisoner.\n\nAlternatively, you can just go ahead and ignore the acquisition of an interpreter and play the game deaf. Doing so adds a greater aura of mystery, enhancing the sense that you're a foreign invader in the land, but it does greatly limit the chances of uncovering all the game’s secrets. Some may relish that challenge, others may not, but the fact that you’re at least given a choice in the matter is a nice touch.\n\nObvious upgrades such as capturing interpreters are one thing, but it pays to complete side missions for other reasons. The resources they offer are absolutely vital to expanding your arsenal and improving the capabilities of your gadgets, thus giving you the means to take down ever more complex bases. Those resources come in the form of various metals, minerals, plants, and other items, all of which are managed through Mother Base, an offshore fortress that resembles an oil rig as imagined by Donald Trump. In other words, it’s really big and really obnoxious.\n\nWithin that overwrought steel construction you can select which weapons to unlock next, which gadgets that you want to upgrade, and in which order departments of the base should be improved. For example, if you want a greater variety of new guns to choose from then you need to prioritise the improvement of Mother Base's research and development platform. Should you want more help spotting enemies when in the field, then you need to put your resources in the intel platform. How many items you can build in unison, and which you can build, is dictated in the first instance by the resources you've got stored, and then by how many personnel you dedicate to each part of the base. You might have all the resources necessary to build that fancy new sniper rifle or cardboard box you've had your eye on, but without the relevant manpower you can't carry out the job."

      "text" : "Assigning personnel to different areas of the base quickly becomes a chore thanks to just how many people the fortress can accommodate and how many different jobs there are. Staff must be assigned to the previously mentioned R&D and intel stations as well as medical, base development, support, and combat wings. While you can opt to have Mother Base auto-assign individuals to certain wings, it's a better idea to go through and do the admin yourself, because the AI doesn't do the best job in matching an individual's skills with a particular department. This tedious resource management is one of MGS V’s biggest failings, particularly when it’s massively overshadowed by the excellent action out in the field. More than once I lazily selected the auto-assign option only to find my overall skill in a certain department had dropped below the point needed to develop a weapon I'd been craving.\n\nYou also need to think about where all those personnel come from, and that means extracting them from the field. It’s here that MGS V redeems itself with one of the most interesting, if subtle, changes that has a dramatic affect on the way it plays. Extractions are performed through the use of the Fulton Recovery device, a balloon attached to your soon-to-be employee that lifts them into the air and sends them off to Mother Base. Standard guards can be gathered easily like this, but it's the commanders and prisoners that harbour the best attributes and, in turn, allow you to upgrade your gear more quickly. And yes, finding these star employees easily means you need those pesky interpreters.\n\nThese Fulton Recoveries change the lens through which you view guards and how you decide how to interact with them. Instead of avoiding enemies or distracting them in order to sneak past, it's now very worthwhile to scout them out and extract them for use aboard Mother Base. This desire to get up close to enemies, take them down, and obtain their services marks a big change in the thinking behind Metal Gear Solid. Where the series has historically tended to single Snake out as a master infiltrator with the ability to enter and exit a locale without leaving a mark, you're now rewarded for leaving as big a mark as possible by extracting everything on offer. If silent avoidance was what game was about in the past, it’s now more about silent attack.",
